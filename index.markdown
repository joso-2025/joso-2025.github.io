### **General setting**: 
The Journées Ondes du Sud-Ouest are an opportunity to bring together researchers from south-west France who are contributing to the simulation of wave propagation phenomena. Topics covered range from mathematical modeling to the implementation of resolution algorithms in advanced computing environments. The integration of artificial intelligence methods and the use of accelerator technologies are also important topics. Particular attention is paid to applications including, but not limited to, defense, aeronautics, underground exploration and medical imaging.
These meetings have been held since 2016, and are co-organized by CEA Cesta, Onera and the Inria center at the University of Bordeaux, three research centers that are very active in this field. The aim of this event is to create and/or strengthen collaborations on a regional and national scale, but also to raise awareness among the local network of SMEs - particularly dynamic in the Nouvelle Aquitaine and Occitanie regions - of the issues involved in numerical simulation on waves, and of the innovation capabilities of public laboratories in the South-West in this field.

### **List of Abstracts**:

| **Hélène Barucq** <br/> Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin discretization for linear anisotropic elastic wave equation |
| :--- |
| This work is concerned with implementing the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to solve the linear anisotropic elastic equation in the frequency domain, focusing in particular on providing a compact description of the discrete problem and an optimal choice of stabilization in defining the HDG numerical traces. Voigt notation is employed in the description of the discrete problem in order to facilitate matrix operation and to provide efficient book-keeping of physical parameters. Additionally, a first-order formulation working with the compliance elasticity tensor is employed to allow for parameter variation within a mesh cell, for better representation of complex media. We determine an optimal choice of stabilization by constructing a hybridized Godunov-upwind flux for anisotropic elasticity possessing three distinct wavespeeds. This stabilization removes the need to choose judiciously scaling factors and can be used as a versatile choice for all materials. Its optimality is established by comparing with identity matrix-based stabilization in a wide range of values for the scaling factor. Numerical investigations are carried out in two and three dimensions, for isotropic elasticity and material with varying degree of anisotropy. |
