### **General setting**

The Journées Ondes du Sud-Ouest are an opportunity to bring together researchers from south-west France who are contributing to the simulation of wave propagation phenomena. Topics covered range from mathematical modeling to the implementation of resolution algorithms in advanced computing environments. The integration of artificial intelligence methods and the use of accelerator technologies are also important topics. Particular attention is paid to applications including, but not limited to, defense, aeronautics, underground exploration and medical imaging.
These meetings have been held since 2016, and are co-organized by CEA Cesta, Onera and the Inria center at the University of Bordeaux, three research centers that are very active in this field. The aim of this event is to create and/or strengthen collaborations on a regional and national scale, but also to raise awareness among the local network of SMEs - particularly dynamic in the Nouvelle Aquitaine and Occitanie regions - of the issues involved in numerical simulation on waves, and of the innovation capabilities of public laboratories in the South-West in this field.

  ## Talk 1
**Title :** Minimization of spurious reflections for non regular traveling waves on nonuniform grids

**Speaker :** Mamadou N'Diaye

**Affiliation :** Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France

**Abstract :**
Spurious wave reflections are likely to occur in explicit fast dynamics computations when coupling spatial discretizations of different types and steps. It corresponds to numerical pollution that does not correspond to physical reflections caused by geometry or material impedance changes at the coupling interface. To investigate this phenomenon, we consider a 1D pre-stretched bar test case in link with Split Hopkinson Bars (SHB) and the coupled FEM-FEM for space discretization combined with leapfrog method for time integration. In this talk, we describe an optimized explicit Runge-Kutta-Nyström (RKN) time integration method to minimize spurious wave generation,  in the context of discontinuous wave propagation on nonuniform meshes. The proposed method, based on a one-dimensional analysis, consists in adjusting the parameter characterizing the RKN methods as a function of the CFL stability condition and the mesh discontinuity ratio used. It has the advantage of being non-intrusive, and can therefore be easily adapted to already existing codes. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in 1D and 2D simulations.

## Talk 2
**Titre :** Time Schemes for Solving Maxwell's Equations in a Mesh Hybridization Strategy

**Speaker :** Xavier Ferrières

**Co-authors :** V. Mouysset, S. Pernet, T. Volpert

**Affiliation :** ONERA - The French Aerospace Lab, F-31055 Toulouse, France

**Abstract :**
The efficient resolution of Maxwell's equations remains a priority in the field of electromagnetic simulation due to the increasing complexity of the structures and systems to be studied or qualified. In the time domain, several schemes have been and are still being studied due to their advantages. In our case, for several years, we have believed that efficient simulation of a computational scene requires dividing it into multiple zones, each treated with the appropriate scheme. In this strategy, we focus on a global meshing of the scene into a Cartesian grid with polyhedral cell inclusions. This approach has the advantage of maximizing the number of Cartesian cells, which is particularly efficient for our methods, while allowing for zones adapted to curved geometries and refinement areas that account for the multi-scale aspects of the computational scene. In our presentation, we propose to showcase the multi-domain/multi-method strategy implemented by providing examples and studies conducted on the hybridization of certain schemes. We will then focus more specifically on the latest research carried out within the framework of theses, using FVTD (Finite Volume Time Domain) and CDO (Compatible Discrete Operator) schemes.

## Talk 3

**Titre :** Conservation of divergence or rotational type constraints of hyperbolic systems with the discontinuous Galerkin method.

**Speaker :** Vincent Perrier

**Affiliation :** Project-team Cagire, Inria & UPPA

**Abstract :**
A number of hyperbolic systems contain implicit conservations of the rotational or divergence of certain unknowns. Examples include the acoustic system (conservation of the velocity rotational), Maxwell's system (conservation of the magnetic field divergence), or the magnetohydrodynamics system (transport of the magnetic field divergence). These constraints are generally difficult to preserve, and we generally resort to staggered schemes: historically, the MAC scheme or the Yee scheme, for example, or their finite element version, with Raviart-Thomas or Nédélec elements. The systematization of the study of these finite elements has been developed within the framework of finite element exterior calculation over the last thirty years.
In this talk, starting from a simple problem (the long-time behavior of the acoustic system in finite volumes on triangular meshes), I will show that the classical discontinuous Galerkin spaces for vectors on triangular meshes can be put into a distributional de-Rham complex for which we can show the equivalence of the discrete and continuous cohomology groups, which is a property identical to the discrete conformal complexes involving the Nédélec and Raviart-Thomas elements. It will then be shown that we can develop approximation spaces on quadrangles on which the same type of property can be proved.
It will further be proved that the classical discontinuous Galerkin method preserves rotationals and divergences, provided that the right approximation space is chosen, and under a diffusion direction assumption on the numerical fluxes.
Finally, theory will be illustrated by numerical results obtained on 2D Maxwell equations, on the acoustic system, and on the induction equation.
